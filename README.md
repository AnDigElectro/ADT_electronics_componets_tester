The article discusses the modification of a universal tester of electronic components on the STM32 microcontroller. The device can measure the parameters of passive, active elements, check the operation of microcircuits and electronic modules using active outputs and communication interfaces. To check and determine the components and microcircuits, a signal or data is supplied, and by changing the value received from the inputs: digital or analog, the type and parameters of the element are determined. Communication interfaces are used to test the modules. The device also has a USB interface for communication with a personal computer (PC), which allows you to load custom programs for testing microcircuits and modules. The device is equipped with a color touchscreen display with a graphical interface, which makes it more convenient for the user to work with it.
